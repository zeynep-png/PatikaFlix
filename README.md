# Array List Practice

In this practice, you are expected to create a list of TV Series and define the objects within it. The elements should be created through the Console screen.

After creating each TV series and adding it to the list, you need to ask the user if they want to add another series. 

Then, perform the following tasks:

1. **Create a new list of comedy series**:  
   - From your initial list, create a new list containing only the comedy series.
   - This new list should include only the following information: Series Name, Series Genre, and Director. (This means you will need another class.)

2. **Display all elements of the new list with all their properties**:  
   - Print all elements of this new list with all their properties.
   - Make sure the list is sorted first by the series names, and then by the director names.
